description: "Use the Zelana TypeScript client to query the sequencer, submit transfers, and track transaction status."
---

## Overview

The TypeScript SDK provides a high-level client (`ZelanaClient`) and low-level
API wrapper (`ApiClient`) for the sequencer HTTP API. It also includes helpers
for shielded transaction utilities and note encryption.

## Install

1. Install the package.

Registry:

```bash
npm install @zelana/sdk
```

Local path (from this repo):

```bash
npm install ../zelana/sdk/typescript
```

If you install from a local path, the package build runs via `npm run build`
and requires Bun because the build script uses `bun build`.

2. Build from source (local path only).

```bash
cd sdk/typescript
bun install
bun run build
```

Verify that `sdk/typescript/dist/index.js` exists before importing the package.

## Quickstart

1. Create a client and check health.

Save the following file as `sdk-quickstart.mjs`:

```javascript sdk-quickstart.mjs
import { ZelanaClient, Keypair, ZelanaError } from '@zelana/sdk';

const keypair = Keypair.generate();
const client = new ZelanaClient({
  baseUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8080',
  keypair,
});

try {
  const health = await client.health();
  console.log('Sequencer healthy:', health.healthy);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ZelanaError) {
    console.error(`Health check failed: ${error.code} - ${error.message}`);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  throw error;
}
```

You should see `Sequencer healthy: true` when the sequencer is running.

2. Submit a transfer and wait for confirmation.

Your sender account must be funded. For local development, use `devDeposit`
in `DEV_MODE=true`, or complete a deposit flow on L1.

```javascript sdk-quickstart.mjs
const recipient = Keypair.generate().publicKey;
const amount = 1_000_000n; // lamports

try {
  const result = await client.transfer(recipient, amount);
  console.log('TX Hash:', result.txHash);

  const confirmed = await client.waitForTransaction(result.txHash);
  console.log('Final status:', confirmed.status);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ZelanaError) {
    console.error(`Transfer failed: ${error.code} - ${error.message}`);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  throw error;
}
```

You should see a transaction hash and a final status of `executed` or `settled`.

## Configuration

Use `ZelanaClient` for common actions and `ApiClient` for raw HTTP access.

- `baseUrl` sets the sequencer API endpoint.
- `keypair` or `signer` provides transaction signing.
- `chainId` overrides the default chain ID of `1`.
- `timeout` and `fetch` (on `ApiClient`) customize network behavior.

If your runtime does not provide `fetch`, pass a custom implementation through
`ApiClientConfig` or `ZelanaClientConfig`.

## Dev Mode Helpers

The client includes development-only methods for local testing.

These methods require the sequencer to run with `DEV_MODE=true`.

```javascript
const devDeposit = await client.devDeposit(5_000_000n);
console.log('Dev deposit:', devDeposit.depositId);
```

## What’s Next

- Use `ApiClient` for batch and transaction queries when you need raw access.
- Explore the Rust crates if you are building services or protocol tooling.
