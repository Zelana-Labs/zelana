## Overview

The Zelana SDKs help you build clients, services, and tooling on top of the
sequencer API and core protocol primitives. Choose the SDK that matches your
runtime and development workflow.

## SDK Options

- **TypeScript SDK** (`/docs/sdk/typescript`): High-level client for web and
  Node.js apps, including helpers for transfers, status polling, and shielded
  transaction utilities.
- **Rust Crates** (`/docs/sdk/rust`): Low-level crates for protocol types,
  encryption, and UDP transport used by sequencer and prover components.

## Common Concepts

- **Sequencer API base URL**: HTTP endpoint used by the TypeScript client for
  health checks, transfers, and status queries.
- **Lamports**: Amounts are represented as `bigint` values in the TypeScript SDK
  and `u64` in Rust.
- **Chain ID**: The TypeScript client defaults to chain ID `1` and allows
  overrides via client configuration.

> If you are running locally, the sequencer defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
> when using `config.toml` from the repository root.
